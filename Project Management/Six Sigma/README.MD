# Six Sigma Folder Layout 
***
This README file shows the general structure of the Six Sigma Folder.  Within each of the subfolders there will be a separate README with additional information about what is contained there as well as possible other information about the files. For example,  there may be a table that shows the concepts or technology used in the file or project.  Certification certificates can be found on the resume section of my portfolio page.  Click [here](https://heinoportfolio.github.io/Resume.html "Matthew's Resume") to be taken to it.
