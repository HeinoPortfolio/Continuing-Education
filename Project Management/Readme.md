<p>This README file shows the general structure of the Project Management Folder Folder.  Within each of the subfolders there will be a separate README with additional information about what is contained there as well as possible other information about the files. For example,  there may be a table that shows the concepts or technology used in the file or project.  Certification certificates can be found on the resume section of my portfolio page.
